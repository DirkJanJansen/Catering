Splitting and combining of tables and seats. Programmable buttons for 10 maingroups of producttypes and 5 subgroups with 18 choices, so 900 products in total.
For all the groupbuttons and productbuttons it is possible to choose your own background color, and when logged on as a administrator the buttonnumbers are displayed for reference reasons on the buttons.

Besides it's possible to scan barcodes for logon, for switching between clients and productscanning for products with barcode provided.
